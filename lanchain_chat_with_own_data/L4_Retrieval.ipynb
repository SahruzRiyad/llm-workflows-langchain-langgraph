       "Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Testing, testing. Okay, cool. Thanks. So all right, online resources. The class has a home page, so it's in on the handouts. I \\nwon't write on the chalkboard — http:// cs229.stanford.edu. And so when there are \\nhomework assignments or things like that, we usually won't sort of — in the mission of \\nsaving trees, we will usually not give out many handouts in class. So homework \\nassignments, homework solutions will be posted online at the course home page.  \\nAs far as this class, I've also written, and I guess I've also revised every year a set of \\nfairly detailed lecture notes that cover the technical content of this class. And so if you \\nvisit the course homepage, you'll also find the detailed lecture notes that go over in detail \\nall the math and equations and so on that I'll be doing in class.  \\nThere's also a newsgroup, su.class.cs229, also written on the handout. This is a \\nnewsgroup that's sort of a forum for people in the class to get to know each other and \\nhave whatever discussions you want to have amongst yourselves. So the class newsgroup \\nwill not be monitored by the TAs and me. But this is a place for you to form study groups \\nor find project partners or discuss homework problems and so on, and it's not monitored \\nby the TAs and me. So feel free to talk trash about this class there.  \\nIf you want to contact the teaching staff, please use the email address written down here, \\ncs229-qa@cs.stanford.edu. This goes to an account that's read by all the TAs and me. So\")"

       "Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"personally could, and this is an instance of maybe computers learning to do things that \\nthey were not programmed explicitly to do.  \\nHere's a more recent, a more modern, more formal definition of machine learning due to \\nTom Mitchell, who says that a well-posed learning problem is defined as follows: He \\nsays that a computer program is set to learn from an experience E with respect to some \\ntask T and some performance measure P if its performance on T as measured by P \\nimproves with experience E. Okay. So not only is it a definition, it even rhymes.  \\nSo, for example, in the case of checkers, the experience E that a program has would be \\nthe experience of playing lots of games of checkers against itself, say. The task T is the \\ntask of playing checkers, and the performance measure P will be something like the \\nfraction of games it wins against a certain set of human opponents. And by this \\ndefinition, we'll say that Arthur Samuel's checkers program has learned to play checkers, \\nokay?  \\nSo as an overview of what we're going to do in this class, this class is sort of organized \\ninto four major sections. We're gonna talk about four major topics in this class, the first \\nof which is supervised learning. So let me give you an example of that.  \\nSo suppose you collect a data set of housing prices. And one of the TAs, Dan Ramage, \\nactually collected a data set for me last week to use in the example later. But suppose that\")"
